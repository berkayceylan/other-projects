I developed 5 years ago a robotic hand using Arduino C and AppInventor, which can be controlled through a phone application using a HTC-06 Bluetooth module. The hand is equipped with servo motors that can be controlled with precision via a slider in the phone app, as well as through tilting the phone. The hand can also be controlled remotely using an IR module on the Arduino. Additionally, I utilized a 3D printer to create the hand, demonstrating my ability to work with advanced technology. This project showcases my technical proficiency in programming, as well as my creativity and passion for developing innovative solutions.
