I have designed and developed an augmented reality teaching tool for the digestive system using Zapworks. By incorporating 3D models and videos, I have created a unique and engaging learning experience for students. To add to the excitement, I presented the cards as magic cards, which not only captured students' attention but also made the learning experience more fun. This tool is a valuable asset for educators looking to teach this complex topic in an interactive and immersive way, and I am proud to have created it.
