As a teacher, I have worked on a variety of projects that showcase my skills and expertise in different programming languages and technologies. One project that I am particularly proud of is a collaboration with a customer to create a program that can detect sign language and translate it into spoken words. The project consists of two programs: a Python program that uses AI to detect sign language from a live camera feed, and a Flutter program that can transfer the phone camera to a website as a live stream, receive the words detected by the Python program, and send them to a Bluetooth device for text-to-speech conversion. This innovative application has the potential to revolutionize communication for people with hearing impairments by providing a real-time, accurate translation of sign language. I am proud of my contribution to this project, which demonstrates my proficiency in both Python and Flutter, as well as my ability to work collaboratively with clients to achieve their goals.
